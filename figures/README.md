This subdirectory contains to figures to provide more visualization of the relationship between variables. These figures are included into the methods section of the paper. 
The histplot_raw_hemog.pdf and .png are the histograms of the hemoglobin levels prior to outlier removal. 
As outliers are defined as 3 standard deviations away from the mean, the histplot_hemog_cleaned.pdf and .png are the histograms distribution of hemoglobin levels after outlier removal. 
To determine the significance of bronchodilators in pulmonary function improvement, the data analyzes the FEV1/FVC before and after administration. 
This visualizes the distribution of the samples and aids in determining normality of the samples for statistical analysis. 
The histo_PREFF.pdf and .png is the distribution of the FEV1/FVC before bronchodilators. 
The histo_POSTFF.pdf and .png is the distribution of the FEV1/FVC after bronchodilators. 
The heatmap_variables.pdf and .png serves a prelimiary measurement of correlation among the variables of the analyzed dataset.
